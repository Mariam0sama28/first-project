        Around 10,000 years ago, cats likely domesticated themselves when they started hanging around human settlements for better rodent-hunting opportunities. Now, there are an estimated 600 million domestic cats living around the world.
        Their cute toe beans, striped and spotted coats, and soft bellies still delight cat lovers everywhere.

           ats are obligate carnivores, which means that they rely on nutrients found only in animal products. Cats evolved as hunters that consume prey that contains high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and a minimal amount of carbohydrates, and their diet still requires these general proportions today. Cats also require more than a dozen other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids.


<a href="As consumers compare the infinite number of pet food products available, digest the promotional art and marketing language, evaluate the many ingredients and attempt to make sense of it all, is it any wonder that choosing the right pet food can seem complicated and confusing?

AAFCO is here to provide pet owners with practical, real-world information for answering questions about pet food. It’s important for us to point out that AAFCO and its members, as feed control officials, are not practicing veterinarians. AAFCO does not provide veterinary medical advice or recommendations of any type.

If a pet is sick, pet owners should immediately seek veterinary care and advice for sick pets before doing anything else.

 ">dryfood</a>
Dry food contains between six and 10 percent water. Depending on the specific formulation, a mixture of ingredients are combined, extruded, and dried into bite-sized pieces. Ingredients may include:

meat and/or meat byproducts
poultry and/or poultry byproducts
grain and/or grain byproducts
fish meal
fiber sources
milk products
vitamin and mineral supplements

The pieces of dry food are often then coated with flavor enhancers, such as animal fat, to make the food more appetizing.

Dry cat food is relatively inexpensive, and since it does not dry out, it offers owners the convenience of “free choice” feeding. However, dry food may be less palatable to a cat than moist or semi-moist food, and depending on the types and quality of the ingredients, may also be less digestible. If you do use dry food, it is important to store unused portions in a cool, dry location, and not to use the food after its expiration date. Owners often buy large amounts of dry food that can sometimes be <br>
stored for months, so checking the expiration date before feeding it to your cat is very important. Storing food for a long period of time decreases the activity and potency of many vitamins and increases the likelihood that fats will become rancid. It’s a good idea to store dry cat food in an airtight container to help prevent nutrient deterioration and maintain flavor.

Semi-Moist Food
Meat and meat byproducts are the primary ingredients of semi-moist food, which contains approximately 35 percent moisture. Other materials, including soybean meal, cereals, grain byproducts, and preservatives are added to make the final product. The cost of semi-moist food is generally mid-range. Semi-moist foods may be more appealing than dry cat food to some cats and can also be fed free choice. After the package is opened, however, the food can dry out, becoming less palatable and/or becoming rancid.

Canned Food
Canned cat food has a moisture content of at least 75 percent, making it a good dietary source of water. It is generally the most expensive type of cat food, but is also highly palatable for most cats. Many different varieties are available, which can be helpful if your cat is a finicky eater. Canned food has the longest shelf life when unopened, but any unused portion of opened canned cat food should be refrigerated to maintain quality and prevent spoilage. Gourmet canned cat foods generally feature meats, such as kidney or liver, and whole meat byproducts as primary ingredients. Some brands, however, may be nutritionally incomplete, and it is important to read the nutrition labels carefully on such specialty cat-food items to ensure that they have a nutritional guarantee.

Choosing A Food
Commercially prepared cat foods have been developed to give your cat the correct balance of nutrients and calories. Basic minimum nutritional requirements for cats have been established by the Feline Nutrition Expert (FNE) Subcommittee of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and manufacturers use these standards in producing cat foods.

Reading the nutrition label on food packaging is the best way to compare cat foods<br>. Pet food manufacturers are required to supply certain nutritional information on the package. Labeling regulations are established by the AAFCO and the United States Food and Drug Administration. All pet foods that carry an AAFCO-approved nutritional guarantee, often referred to as the“AAFCO statement,” are considered to be nutritionally complete and balanced<br>.

A cat’s nutritional requirements change through different stages of life. These stages include kittenhood, adulthood, pregnancy, and lactation. The nutritional claim on the cat food label should state the stage of a cat’s life cycle for which the food is complete and balanced, and that it meets the requirements of the AAFCO. Some cat foods are formulated for all life stages, which can simplify the selection process for owners with multiple cats of different ages.

In choosing a cat food, it is also important to read the ingredients list. As with human foods, the items are listed in order of decreasing proportional weight. Look for foods in which meat, meat byproducts, or seafood are listed among the first few ingredients, as this indicates the food probably contains enough animal-source ingredients to supply essential amino acids and fatty acids.

Once you have determined that a food is complete and balanced, choosing between the types of food may be a matter of what your cat prefers. Some cats like canned food, some like dry food, and some like a combination of the two. Choose the ones that work best for your cat.

      <h3 class="color">smart Cats</h3>
      <p  class="shadow">
        When evaluating the intelligence of different animal species, we often look at the number of neurons within an animal’s brain.

A 2016 study calculated the number of nerve cells within the cerebral cortex of the brain (the region of the brain that is thought to most directly contribute to intelligence) in a number of different animal species.

Researchers found that cats have nearly twice as many cortical neurons (300 million) as dogs (160 million), which was taken as evidence that cats are smarter than dogs.

While contradictory findings have been observed in other studies, these contradictory studies involved small sample sizes and therefore shouldn’t be taken as the last word on the dog vs. cat intelligence debate. Although a number of studies have been performed, clear, consistent results are currently lacking.

Realistically, it’s important to realize there are significant challenges in calculating exact neuron numbers within the brain of a particular species. Counting neurons is unlikely to ever settle the age-old debate of which species is smarter, cats or dogs?

          do you believe that?
          it found that hospitalcat can recgonize the people who will die before they ?is it weird right ? 
          was a therapy cat who as of 2005 lived in the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. He came to public attention in 2007 when he was featured in an article by geriatrician David Dosa in the New England Journal of Medicine. According to Dosa, Oscar appeared able to predict the impending death of terminally ill patients by choosing to nap next to them a few hours before they died. Hypotheses for this ability include that Oscar was picking up on the lack of movement in such patients or that he could smell biochemicals released by dying cells.[1]

Oscar's abilities were also the subject of Dr. Dosa's 2010 book, Making Rounds with Oscar: The Extraordinary Gift of an Ordinary Cat.[2] Oscar died at the age of 17, on February 22, 2022, accompanied by friends, after a brief illness.[3][4]
